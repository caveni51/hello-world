# hello-world
First repository

This is my first github repository. I am a beginning developer studying software engineering in school. By the end of this summer I will have some projects to add to my github account. By emersing myself in as much coding as possible, I hope to get the hang of the coding aspect, so that i can focus on the design/development side of things.
